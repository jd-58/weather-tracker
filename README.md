# Weather Analyzer

Welcome to my Weather Analyzer project! Built in x86 Assembly, this tool will track user-entered daily temperature readings, and output helpful statistics such as the minimum, maximum, and average temperature. It will also tell the user how
many cold, cool, warm, and hot days there were!
